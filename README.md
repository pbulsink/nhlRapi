# NHL API for R

## Introduction

The NHL has a poorly documented API that has a lot of information available in it for absolutely free. There are statistics and records available, focusing on teams, players, games, drafts, prospects, and awards. This package aims to provide a basic API wrapper for use in R. Significant information required for the development of this package comes from [https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi).

## Usage
Initially this API will be a dumb wrapper only, calling the API and returning the data as a json object as recieved. Future versions may initiate data cleaning or other manipulations. 

## Copyright
All data, teams, logos, and information is copyright NHL and its teams, with compliance to the copyright statement recieved from each API call.
